# Lessons Learned

Authoritative record of lessons learned during the development of this system:
the situation, the pitfall, and the correct solution for each lesson.
Managed by the `learned-lesson-tracker` skill — do not edit the index block or
the entry markers by hand; use `scripts/manage_lessons.py` (init / add / sync /
check / next-id). The index below is machine-readable (TSV between
`LLT:INDEX:BEGIN`/`LLT:INDEX:END` markers) and lists every entry with its
line range.

## LLT-0001 — cyclonedx CLI binary is cyclonedx-py, not cyclonedx-bom

- **Recorded:** 2026-10-18
- **Category:** tooling
- **Severity:** medium
- **Status:** active
- **Context:** Wiring SBOM generation into the Makefile and CI for the SecureTrace bootstrap (B1). The PyPI package is named cyclonedx-bom, so the natural guess for the entrypoint was cyclonedx-bom.
- **Pitfall:** Invoking cyclonedx-bom fails with command-not-found; the package installs the binary as cyclonedx-py. A Makefile variable or CI step written from the package name silently breaks SBOM generation.
- **Solution:** Set the Makefile CDX variable to cyclonedx-py and use that name in CI. Add a smoke check (cyclonedx-py --version) to setup-ci so the mismatch is caught at setup time.
- **Supersedes:** —
- **Prevention:** Makefile setup target runs `$(CDX) --version`; CI setup-ci step runs the same
- **References:** requirements-dev.in; Makefile (CDX variable); https://pypi.org/project/cyclonedx-bom/

## LLT-0002 — skill scripts must be vendored into the repo for CI and hooks

- **Recorded:** 2026-10-18
- **Category:** architecture
- **Severity:** medium
- **Status:** active
- **Context:** Configuring SecureTrace gates (B1): pre-commit hooks and GitHub Actions must run the backlog-manager / learned-lesson-tracker / algorithm-records-keeper index scripts, but those scripts live in the machine-local skill directory (~/.lmstudio/skills/...).
- **Pitfall:** A hook or CI job that calls the skill path breaks on every other checkout, on CI runners, and on fresh machines; the gate becomes environment-specific and silently unenforceable.
- **Solution:** Vendor the three scripts into scripts/ (backlog_index.py, manage_lessons.py, algorithm_index.py) with a provenance note in each docstring, and make hooks, Makefile, and CI all reference the vendored copies. Skill updates require a deliberate re-vendoring change.
- **Supersedes:** —
- **Prevention:** hooks/, Makefile, and .github/ reference only scripts/; CI runs on a clean runner which would fail otherwise
- **References:** scripts/backlog_index.py; scripts/manage_lessons.py; scripts/algorithm_index.py

## LLT-0003 — zsh does not word-split unquoted variables

- **Recorded:** 2026-10-18
- **Category:** environment
- **Severity:** low
- **Status:** active
- **Context:** Batch shell work during B1 bootstrap, e.g. iterating over 'pair' strings with set -- $pair in zsh.
- **Pitfall:** In zsh, unquoted variable expansion is NOT word-split by default, so for-loop / set -- $var constructs silently produce a single token and loops misbehave with no error.
- **Solution:** Use explicit per-item commands, or split deliberately with ${(z)var} / ${=var}; prefer one command per call when scripting from an agent.
- **Supersedes:** —
- **Prevention:** prefer explicit invocations in agent shell work; zsh -c one-liners per item
- **References:** zsh EXPAND_SH_WORD_SPLIT man entry
